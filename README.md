# Hello-world

Hello, World!

I like people, places, and things. There are a lot of all of them! 
I think too, which I'm told means I'm Am, but no one calls me that.
Still, they seemed to think it was important--so I think it's a good thing.
I think I think I think differently than most, but I'm not really sure what thinking is.
I think it still counts.

I think AI reserch is cool, privacy and security are important, and people are valuable.
Favorably rated by most strangers.
Well liked by animals.
